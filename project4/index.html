					<p>My name is Jalen Terrell Lane. I am 19 years old, and I was born on August 26th 2004. I've lived in a few places, but I currently live in Maryland. <br>
My goal in life is to find something that I enjoy so much that I don't want to retire. I believe that if you truly enjoy what you do, there is no such thing as retirement. <br> The reason that I chose to enter the web development field is because it combines two things I enjoy doing: designing things and programming! Becoming a front-end developer allows me to design websites as well as create cool features for them.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<div class="group">
				<p>As a military child, I moved frequently. I've been to a total of 5 schools, and I finished high school in Maryland. After high school, I went to <i>Penn State</i> for a year. My first year didn't go very well, so I decided to move to online school because I would be closer to home, and it was cheaper. </p>
			</div>

			<h2>Future Goals</a></h2>
			<div class="group">
				<p>The end goal is for me to have my own business where clients hire me to create websites and graphics for their businesses. The reason I want to become self-employed is because I want to be able to control my work hours, my rates, and what I will and will not do. I believe that everyone should try to be self-employed in some capacity, or have a side hustle that they can earn a secondary income source from.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Hobbies</a></h2>
			<div class="group">
				<p>I really enjoy playing competitive video games. The difference between competitive video games and regular video games is that competitive games are a lot more competitive and are often turned into <i>esports</i>. An <i>esport</i> is a video game that is played by professional players, similar to regular sports. There's leagues that you can join from the lowest level of play to the best players in the world! <br> Another hobby that I have is photography. The reason I enjoy photography is that I love to capture the beauty in the world.</p>
